Computer Programming

Hi! My name's Dan. I'm a grade 12 student and I am very fond of computer science. 

I'm not a geek or a nerd or even an expert. I just enjoy computer science for what it is and what it represents. It's a part of our past (not long ago though), our present, and our future. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are now. This got off topic very quickly, so...boom! Now I'll be mentioning my experience: 

As i mentioned before, I am not an expert- and I mean it. I was introduced to computer science from a relatively young age- 10-11 years old and continued studying it for 8 years. But as I understood almost a decade later- all of what I did for many years was at beginner or mediate levels. With this said, the only language(s) I am actually really comfortable with is many variations of Pascal and Delphi 7. I was once capable of writing code in C++; however, that was a long time ago. 

I am moving towards this goal and I hope that in the near future my career will be, at least in the minimum, conected with artificial intelligence or big data. 

My favourite things about computer programming are the challeneges I face while writing my code and figuring out how to do things correctly and many other things. 

My least favourite thing(s) about computer programming are the unnecessary and unintentional mistakes that almost every programmer, me included, makes all the time. They can range from small to big mistakes. The worst kind are small ones because it is almost impossible to notice them. You can be trying to figure out why the program doesn't run for days and weeks and the reason for all that misery could be a missed semicolon. 

And that's all folks. Subscribe to my blog. You don't have to wait a long time- I post frequently, like almost once every 20 years. 

Stay swifty.
