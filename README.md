Computer Programming

Hi! My name's Dan. I'm a grade 12 student and I am very fond of computer science. 

I'm not a geek or a nerd or even an expert. I just enjoy computer science for what it is and what it represents. It's a part of our past (not long ago though), our present, and our future. Without it, he wouldn't be where we are now. This is getting a little off topic, so now I'll be mentioning my experience.
