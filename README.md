Computer Programming! 

Hi! My name's Dan. I'm a grade 12 student and I am very fond of computer science. 

I'm not a geek or a nerd or even an expert. I just enjoy computer science for what it is and what it represents. It's a part of our past (not long ago though), a major part of our present and our future. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are now. Ummmm, this got off topic very quickly, so...boom! Now I'll be mentioning my experience: 

As I mentioned before, I am not an expert- and I mean it. I was introduced to computer science from a relatively young age- 10-11 years old and continued studying it for 8+ years. But as I understood almost a decade later- all of what I did for many years was at beginner or mediate levels. With this said, the only language(s) I am actually really comfortable with is many variations of Pascal: Delphi 7, Free Pascal, Dev-Pascal, Turbo Pascal, and etc. I was once capable of writing code in C++; however, that was a long time ago. 

I hope that in the near future my career will be, at least in the minimum, connected with artificial intelligence or big data, and every day I am moving towards this goal.

My favourite things about computer programming are the challenges I face while writing my code and figuring out the correct way of doing so. Overall, it is very interesting, fun, and I get to work at my own pace and in a comfortable environment at any moment. 

My least favourite things about computer programming are the unnecessary and unintentional mistakes that almost every programmer, me included, makes all the time. They can range from small to big mistakes. The worst kinds are small ones because it is almost impossible to notice them. You can be trying to figure out why the program doesn't run for days, weeks and the reason for all that misery could be a missed semicolon. 

And that's all folks. Subscribe to my blog. You don't have to wait a long time- I post frequently, like almost once every 20 years. Don't miss out on all the interesting posts!
