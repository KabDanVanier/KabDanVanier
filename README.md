Computer Programming

Hi! My name's Dan. I'm a grade 12 student and I am very fond of computer science. 

I'm not a geek or a nerd or even an expert. I just enjoy computer science for what it is and what it represents. It's a part of our past (not long ago though), our present, and our future. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are now. This got off topic very quickly, so...boom! Now I'll be mentioning my experience: 

As i mentioned before, I am not an expert- and I mean it. With this said, the only language(s) I am actually really comfortable with is many variations of Pascal and Delphi 7.
